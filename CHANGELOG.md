# CHANGELOG

## NEXT RELEASE

* Removed `branch` flag and functionality as it was causing issues and inconsistencies when cloning/pulling and branches didn't match up. This became especially prevelant when repos started changing from `master` to `main`

## v3.1.0 (2020-12-16)

* Changed all classmethods to staticmethods
* Corrected a bug where org names may not have had whitespace stripped properly
* CLI arguments now have an explicit default of `False`, this shouldn't change behavior from previous versions
* CLI default argument for `branch` has been changed from `master` to `None` and is handled via logic now. If no branch is specified, the default repo branch will be used instead of blindly assuming that `master` is the default branch (closes #18)
* Revamped the entire test suite to use conftest, simplified boilerplate, etc
